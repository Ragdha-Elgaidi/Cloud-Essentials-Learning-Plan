# The AWS Well-Architected Framework
- The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps you understand how to design and operate reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the AWS Cloud. It provides a way for you to consistently measure your architecture against best practices and design principles and identify areas for improvement.
## The Well-Architected Framework is based on six pillars: 
### Operational excellence
- Operational excellence is the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures.  
- Design principles for operational excellence in the cloud include performing operations as code, annotating documentation, anticipating failure, and frequently making small, reversible changes.
### Security
- The Security pillar is the ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies. 
- When considering the security of your architecture, apply these best practices:
   - Automate security best practices when possible.
   - Apply security at all layers.
   - Protect data in transit and at rest.
### Reliability
- Reliability is the ability of a system to do the following:
   - Recover from infrastructure or service disruptions
   - Dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand
   - Mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues
- Reliability includes testing recovery procedures, scaling horizontally to increase aggregate system availability, and automatically recovering from failure.
### Performance efficiency
- Performance efficiency is the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve. 
- Evaluating the performance efficiency of your architecture includes experimenting more often, using serverless architectures, and designing systems to be able to go global in minutes.
### Cost optimization
- Cost optimization is the ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point. 
- Cost optimization includes adopting a consumption model, analyzing and attributing expenditure, and using managed services to reduce the cost of ownership.
### Sustainability
- In December 2021, AWS introduced a sustainability pillar as part of the AWS Well-Architected Framework.
- Sustainability is the ability to continually improve sustainability impacts by reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency across all components of a workload by maximizing the benefits from the provisioned resources and minimizing the total resources required.
- To facilitate good design for sustainability:
   - Understand your impact
   - Establish sustainability goals
   - Maximize utilization
   - Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings
   - Use managed services
   - Reduce the downstream impact of your cloud workloads
